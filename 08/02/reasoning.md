7 segment displays have four numbers with unique number of segments:

- 1 has 2 segments,
- 7 has 3 segments,
- 4 has 4 segments, and
- 8 as all 7 segments

The other digits are:
- 2 has 5 segments, sharing 1 segment with 1, 2 with 7, and 2 with 4
- 5 has 5 segments, sharing 1 segment with 1, 2 with 7, and 3 with 4
- 6 has 6 segments, sharing 1 segment with 1, 2 with 7, and 3 with 4
- 3 has 5 segments, containing all 2 of 1, all 3 of 7, and sharing 3 with 4
- 0 has 6 segments, containing all 2 of 1, all 3 of 7, and sharing 3 with 4
- 9 has 6 segments, containing all 2 of 1, all 3 of 7 and all 4 of 4

-> knowing 1 and 4 we can deduce all other numbers
