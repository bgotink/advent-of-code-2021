# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) (AoC) in Rust.

Some context: I'd never written any rust or even read any rust tutorials before starting. Don't expect any of the `.rs` files in this repo to contain clean code or idiomatic rust.

## Execution

Run a solution by compiling using the `run.sh` script:

```bash
./run.sh 01 01
./run.sh 20 02
./run.sh 24
```

Run `./run.sh` for help output.

Alternatively, compile one of the `program.rs` files and execute the resulting binary with a single input: the path to an input file. These files are bundled in the same folders as the program files, called `input.dat` for the real input and optionally one or more `test.dat` files containing example input files given in the AoC problem statement.
